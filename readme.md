# Send to pc
Warning: this is made for myself and my own requirements, I do not recommend using it.

My motivation behind this project is that there was no easy way to send files from my phone to my main PC. This is just a simple deno server with endpoints that process copying to clipboard or saving what was sent to a file. (Client behaviour implemented in Shortcuts on iOS)
